      <h2>What is Drag Racing?</h2>
      <div class="text">
        <div>
          <p>Drag racing is the ultimate test of acceleration and timing. Specifically bracket drag racing, is a competitive form of drag racing that balances the field for cars of all performance levels. Each driver sets a <i>dial in</i> time predicting how fast their car will run. The slower cars gets a "head start" based on the difference in times, and the winner is the driver who comes closest to their prediction without going faster, getting beat by the slower car reaching the line first, and all revolves around timing from off the start line.</p>
          <p>It's not just about having the fastest car, it's about reaction time, driving skill, and consistency. It's a balance of the perfect combination of power, and traction, and your ability to manage the car.</p>
          <p>Races are often won or lost by thousandths of a second!</p>
