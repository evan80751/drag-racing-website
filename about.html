    <section class="story">
      <h2>Growing Up at the Track</h2>
      <p>My introduction to drag racing began before I could even walk. Both of my parents raced, which meant I spent my entire childhood at the drag strip. 
        From the time I was a baby, Juleburg Dragstrip in Colorado became my second home.</p>

      <p>One of my most cherished childhood memories involves a special lady I used to call my "Race Grandma." She was a family friend who became like extended family to me. 
        Whenever my parents brought me to the track, I'd spend time with her, watching races together, and even taking the ATV she had around the track grounds just for something to do. 
        Those early experiences shaped my love for the sport and the tight-knit community that surrounds it.</p>

    <!--First Races-->
    <section class="first-races">
      <h2>Taking The Wheel</h2>
      <p>My first taste of actual racing came at the age of 16 through high school drag events at Julesburg. I'll never forget making my first ever run of my own, in my 2010 VW Passat 2.0T, competing against other high school kids. 
        The excitement of being behind the wheel on the track instead of just watching from the sidelines was incredible.</p>

      <p>When I turned 18, I graudated to the real events and started racing my new to me at the time 2017 VW Passat VR6. While I occasionally got to take my dad's 1979 El Camino with its 383 V8 down the track. 
        But there was just something so special about racing my own car, something that was mine, that I worked hard for. It felt like my achievement, my responsibility, my passion.</p>

    <!--Racing Today-->

      <h2>Racing Today</h2>
      <p>These days, I unfortunately don't get to race often due to being in College, and in another state (Kansas). However, everytime I go home in the sumemr time and get the chance to go, I take it, even if it's just to watch.</p>

      <p>The technical side of the sport fascinated me as much as the racing itself. I've learned so much over the years, like throttle and traction management, how to cut good reaction times, the mental game of staying in the right head space during a run, and the strategy of setting accurate dial-in times. 
        This technical knowledge and the experience overall has even influenced my computer science studies, sparking my interest in automotive computer systems, fuel management, timing, launch control, and even vehicle safety systems</p>

    <!--Favorite Memories-->
    <section class="favorite-memories">
      <h2>Unforgettable Moments</h2>
      <p>This past summer brought one of my proudest achievements - my first ever perfect light (.000 reaction time), which is incredibly hard and rare. The precision required and satisfaction of nailing it perfectly was incredible. 
        But honestly, my second favorite memory is still that very first run down the track as a teenager. 
        After years of anticipation, finally experiencing that acceleration and the quarter-mile rush was everything to me!</p>

    <!--Community-->
    <section class="community">
      <h2>More Than Just Racing</h2>
      <p>What keeps bringing me back to Julesburg isn't just the racing, it's the people. The drag racing communty there has always felt like an extended family. 
        Everyone is welcoming, supportive, and eager to help others aswell as newcomers to the sports. It's amazing how people who are your competition on the track become your biggest supporters off the track.</p>

      <p>This sport has connected me with friends and even strengthened family bonds. Several of my family members race as well, creating shared experiences and memories that go far beyond just the races.</p>

    <!--Future Goals-->
    <section class="future-goals">
      <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
      <p>Unfortunately, being in college limits how often I can make it to the track these days. But my passion for the sport continues to grow. 
        I'm eager to explore other drag strips beyond Julesburg and experience different racing communities.</p>

      <p>My current goal is to eventually upgrade to a B9.5 Audi S5 Prestige and bring that to the track. 
        It's been a dream car of mine for the past couple of years, and love the power potential of the platform.</p>
